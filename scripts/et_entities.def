/*QUAKED worldspawn (0 0 0) ? NO_GT_WOLF NO_STOPWATCH - NO_LMS
-------- KEYS --------
"music" wav file to play throughout the map.
"_ambient" Raises all light values in map by specified amount.
"_minlight" Minimum light level throughout the map.
"_minvertexlight" Minimum light level for vertex-lit surfaces.
"_mingridlight" Minimum light level for lightgrid.
"_color" Sets color of ambient lighting. Normalized R G B value. Default 1.0 1.0 1.0. Value of 0.0 0.0 0.0 reverts to default. This affects both _ambient and _minlight.
"sun" Shader to use for 'sun' image
"_blocksize" q3map2 always splits the BSP tree along the planes X=blocksize*n and Y=_blocksize*n. Default _blocksize value is 1024. Increase the _blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with low structural brush density.
"gridsize" granularity of the lightgrid created by q3map2. Values of three intergers by spaces, represents number of units between grid points in X, Y and Z. Default gridsize is 128 128 256. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.
"_fog" fog shader to apply throughout the map.
"fogclip" Determines how far world is drawn. Note that this is not actual game units, but rather calculates distance between PVS clusters, therefore _blocksize will affect this key.
"_farplanedist" Same as "fogclip", just with proper "_" compiler prefix.
"atmosphere" specifies the atmosphere (rain/snow) in map. You must generate tracemap for atmosphere to work.
"mapcoordsmins" Top left corner coordinate. Example "-256 256".
"mapcoordsmaxs" Lower right corner coordinate. Example "256 -256". Both mapcoordsmins and mapcoordsmaxs must be set for command map and auto map to work properly.
"_styleNalphaGen" accepts standard waveform functions. Used in conjunction with light entities and light-emitting shaders where N is the index value for "style" or "q3map_lightStyle". Valid index range is 1-31.
"_styleNrgbGen" accepts standard waveform functions. Used in conjunction with light entities and light-emitting shaders where N is the index value for "style" or "q3map_lightStyle". Valid index range is 1-31.
"noexplosives" Disables explosives. 0 explosives are allowed. 1 no explosive weapons. 2 no dynamite.
"nofalldamage" 0 = fall damage disabled only on surfaceparm nodamage. 1 = fall damage enabled only on surfaceparm nodamage. 2 = fall damage disabled everywhere. Default 0.
"noghost" Disables player ghosting.
"nogod" Disables god mode.
"nogoto" Disables goto.
"nojumpdelay" 0 = jump delay disabled only on surfaceparm monsterslicknorth. 1 = jump delay enabled only on surfaceparm monsterslicknorth. Default 0.

"nooverbounce" 0 = cannot overbounce on surfaces with surfaceparm monsterslicksouth. 1 = can only overbounce on surfaces with surfaceparm monsterslicksouth. Default 0.
"noprone" 0 = cannot prone inside of surfaceparm donotenter. 1 = cannot prone outside of surfaceparm donotenter. Default 0.
"nosave" 0 = cannot save inside of surfaceparm clusterportal. 1 = cannot save outside of surfaceparm clusterportal. Default 0.
"portalgun_spawn" Toggles whether players should spawn with a portal gun.
"portalsurfaces" 0 = players can only shoot portals to surfaces with surfaceparm monsterslickeast. 1 = players cannot shoot portals to surfaces with surfaceparm monsterslickeast. Default 1
"portalteam" If set to 0, players can only go to own portals. If set to 1, players can also go to fireteam mates' portals. If set to 2, anyone can go to anyones portals. Default 0.
"savelimit" If set to higher than 0, saves are limited to the set value.
"strictsaveload" Limit save/load. Bitmask or string value. 1/move = cannot save while moving. 2/dead = cannot save/load while dead. Combine strings using | (eg. move | dead).

"angle" rotation value for Z
"angles" rotation value for X Y Z
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
(none)
-------- NOTES --------
Allows you to place a static "far away" looking scene around the map.
You should place this entity in the exact middle of your skybox area.

You MUST target a dlight with this entity.

Target a box to dlights to have them activate/deactivate with the system (use a stylestring that matches the cycletime for the alarmbox sound)
alarm sound locations are also placed in the dlights, so wherever you place an attached dlight, you will hear the alarm

Teamed alarm_boxes work in tandem (tswitches/lights syncronize)

/*QUAKED dlight (0 1 0) (-12 -12 -12) (12 12 12) - STARTOFF ONETIME
-------- KEYS --------
"style" value is an int from 1-19 that contains a pre-defined 'flicker' string.
"stylestring" set your own 'flicker' string.  (ex. "klmnmlk"). NOTE: this should be all lowercase. If both "style" and "stylestring" are set, "style" is ignored.
"offset" change the initial index in a style string.  So val of 3 in the above example would start this light at 'N'.  (used to get dlights using the same style out of sync).
"atten" offset from the alpha values of the stylestring.  stylestring of "ddeeffzz" with an atten of -1 would result in "ccddeeyy"
"shader" name of shader to apply
"sound" sound to loop every cycle (this actually just plays the sound at the beginning of each cycle)
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
STARTOFF doesn't spawn in until triggered
ONETIME	when the dlight is triggered, it will play through it's cycle once, then shut down until triggered again.
-------- NOTES --------
Stylestring characters run at 10 cps in the game (meaning the alphabet, at 24 characters, would take 2.4 seconds to cycle).
Characters in stylestring represent the intensity of light: a = lowest and z = highest.
Use color picker to set color or key "color". Values are 0.0-1.0 for each color (R G B).
If using "sound", make sure you set the key to "sound" instead of "noise"! The sound button sets "noise" key instead of "sound".
The intensity of dlights cannot be scaled up or down, they have fixed intensity tied to the characters.

Pre-defined style strings:
1 - "mmnmmommommnonmmonqnmmo"
2 - "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba"
3 - "mmmmmaaaaammmmmaaaaaabcdefgabcdefg"
4 - "ma"
